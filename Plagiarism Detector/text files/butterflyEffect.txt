This was the question posed by Edward Norton Lorenz in 1963 . It originated from his work on weather prediction, when he discovered that small differences in initial conditions could lead to drastically different outcomes.
Historically, science embraced determinism, the belief that the future is fixed and predictable, famously illustrated by Laplace's demon. However, systems like the three-body problem and Lorenz's weather models revealed chaos - where small differences lead to wildly divergent outcomes. This phenomenon, known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions, is the hallmark of chaos theory.
