When I was eight-years-old I despised change, no matter what it was or how “good” the transition would be. Some would even comment that when it came to change, I was a prude child. However, the day that changed my life was when my parents said in the most optimistic tone that.“We are moving to the United States!” These words were my greatest undoing and the thought of leaving never crossed my mind ever. I remember being speechless and wanting to cry, but could not bring myself to. I wanted to stay in Tokyo, Japan, in the dark-wooden, two story house with tatami floors, and the sliding doors that were connected to each room, because it held the most precious memories of hide-and-go-seek to playing sumo matches against my cousins. However, my older sister bawled and begged my parents. To let us stay in Japan and that they could go. But my parents wanted all of us to stick together because family sticks together no matter what for the good in the worst of times.
